                        <h3>Project Summary</h3>
                        <p>I completed this project for a client on Upwork, where I created a comprehensive environmental impact assessment map for Webequie, Ontario, Canada. This project aimed to provide valuable insights for geoscientists, policymakers, and environmental agencies by integrating diverse spatial data and highlighting critical environmental changes.</p>
                        <p>Webequie, Ontario, faces numerous environmental challenges due to changing climatic conditions and human activities. To address these challenges, I developed an environmental impact assessment map using ArcGIS Pro. This map serves as a vital tool for decision-makers to understand and mitigate the impacts on the local ecosystem.</p>
                        <p>The first step in the project was to gather various spatial data layers, including topography, land use, and hydrology. I also collected environmental data such as sea level change projections and climate change indicators. Integrating these diverse data sets into a cohesive map was crucial for providing a comprehensive view of the area.</p>

                <div class="second">
                    <p>The map provided detailed visualizations of current environmental conditions and future scenarios based on climate models. By projecting potential impacts of climate change, the map helps stakeholders plan and implement effective mitigation and adaptation strategies.</p>
