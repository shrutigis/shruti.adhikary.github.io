                        <h3>Project Summary</h3>
                        <p>On GIS Day, I had the chance to work on a project mapping dengue cases in Nepal from July to October 2022. This project was organized by the Nepal Geomatics Society and gave me an opportunity to use my GIS skills to tackle an important health issue.</p>
                        <h4>Understanding the Dengue Outbreak</h4>
                        <p>Dengue fever is a disease spread by mosquitoes and caused a major health concern in Nepal in 2022. There were many cases reported across different districts, and it was important to understand where the disease was spreading the most.</p>
                        <h4>Using GIS for Public Health</h4>
                        <p>Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are very useful in public health for showing disease patterns and helping people make better decisions. In this project, I used GIS to create a map that showed the number of dengue cases reported in each district of Nepal over the four months.</p>

                    <h3>Data Collection and Analysis</h3>
                    <p>I worked on the data from the Ministry of Health and Population for this project, ensuring it was accurate and reliable. Using ArcGIS software, I processed and analyzed the data to create a detailed map that showed which areas were most affected by the dengue outbreak. This map helped public health officials and policymakers understand where to focus their efforts.</p>
                    <div class="section">
                        <h3>Key Findings</h3>
                        <p>The map provides insights on several important topics as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Some districts had more dengue cases than others, showing potential hotspots.</li>
                            <li>The number of cases changed over the four months, with certain times seeing more cases, likely due to weather conditions that helped mosquitoes breed.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div> 
                </div>
                <div class="third">
                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>Working on this project was a great experience and showed how powerful GIS can be in solving public health problems. By creating this map, I provided valuable information that can help develop better strategies to prevent and control dengue. This project showed the importance of GIS in public health and the need for ongoing monitoring and data analysis to fight diseases like dengue.</p>
