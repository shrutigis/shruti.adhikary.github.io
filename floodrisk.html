                        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                        <p>Flooding is a serious concern for the residents along the Kuils River. To address this, I used HEC-RAS simulation software to model various flood scenarios. This helped me identify areas at high risk of flooding and propose effective mitigation measures.</p>
                        <h3>Data Collection and Processing</h3>
                        <p>I started by gathering high-resolution photogrammetry data, which included Digital Elevation Models (DEM) and point cloud data. This data provided a detailed view of the area's topography and was crucial for building an accurate hydraulic model in HEC-RAS.</p>
                        <h3>Developing the Hydraulic Model</h3>
                        <p>Using the collected data, I developed a detailed hydraulic model in HEC-RAS. This model simulated different flood scenarios, showing how water would flow during heavy rains and where it would likely overflow its banks.</p>

                    <h3>Analyzing Flood Scenarios</h3>
                    <p>The simulations revealed the potential inundation extents for various flood events. By analyzing these scenarios, I identified high-risk zones where flooding could cause significant damage to homes and infrastructure.</p>
                    <div class="section">
                        <h3>Key Findings</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Several residential areas were found to be at high risk of flooding, especially during extreme weather events.</li>
                            <li>The model showed how changes in the riverâ€™s flow and nearby land use could impact flood extents.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p>This project, completed for a client from Upwork, showcased my expertise in using advanced GIS and hydraulic modeling techniques to solve real-world environmental challenges. By conducting this flood risk assessment, I provided valuable insights that can help protect residential areas along the Kuils River from future flooding events. Through this project, I demonstrated my ability to apply technical skills to address pressing environmental issues and contribute to the safety and well-being of communities.</p>
